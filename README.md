# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying as expected.  The problem stems from a misconfiguration of the parent element's flexbox properties, leading to unexpected rendering of the child elements. 

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the code (you'll need a Tailwind CSS setup).
